Objective:
Implementation of Image restoration algorithms for image denoising and deblurring.

Achievments:     
●	Implemented image processing algorithms for different spatial filters: Harmonic, Adaptive local, Adaptive median filters for noise reduction of different types of noises such as Gaussian, salt & pepper, etc. to restore the image. Implemented inverse filter and wiener filter to Deblur the image in frequency domain.     
●	Analyzed the quality of algorithms quantitatively using SSIM, MSE and PSNR methods to ascertain suitability of filters.
